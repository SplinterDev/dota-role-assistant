# Dota 2 Role Assistant

The goal of the Dota 2 Role Assistant is to make it easier for players to filter
Heroes by **roles**. The filters also include **main attribute** and
**complexity**, just like the game does, but I wanted to be able to find a
**durable support** or a **jungler initiator**, and now I can.
