As the universe thundered into being, this mind was fragmented and scattered. Two among its greater fragments--who would come to be named Radiant and Dire--found themselves locked in vicious opposition, and began twisting all of creation to serve their conflict.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br><br>As war and cataclysm threatened the nascent cosmos, the will of a third fragment made itself known. Naming itself Zet, this intellect sought to resolve the disharmony and return all to perfect unity. Appalled by its kin\'s conflicting nature, Zet gathered the sum of its power. In a sudden flash, it overwhelmed its siblings, and fused the warring aspects into a stellar sphere before hurling them into the darkness to orbit a nondescript world. Harmony was restored, though only the barest fraction of Zet\'s strength remained. Setting its gaze on the prison, Zet chose to use its weakened power to serve as watchful warden until time\'s end. For uncounted aeons, this vigil stood.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br><br>Life flourished upon the world below, oblivious to the dangers imprisoned within the softly glowing moon, or of Zet\'s struggles to contain them. As the captives\' eternal clash reverberated within, the surface of the prison shuddered, over time beginning to crack. Ultimately, Zet\'s depleted power proved insufficient to contain the breach, and at last the moon was shattered. The prison\'s ancient inhabitants had escaped to sow their conflict anew.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br><br>Flung to the farthest reaches by the prison\'s explosion, Zet was transformed by the dissonant energies of its former captives. No longer of single form and thought, its presence had become split among many--some lesser, some greater--each connected by a fleeting arc of consciousness. Struggling to suppress its own disunity, Zet sped toward the burgeoning conflict of its siblings, bending its fractured wills toward a singular conclusion: the aspects of the primordial mind must be made to reunite, or all must be destroyed lest the conflict spread further...","hype_loc":"A splintered fragment of the same primordial power as the Ancients themselves, Zet the Arc Warden has pledged to see the clash between Radiant and Dire finally end. <b>Assault lone enemies</b> with fluxing energy, or distort space to generate a <b>protective field</b> around allies. <b>Summon a Spark Wraith</b> to patrol an area for enemies to infuse with harmful magic, then <b>create a double</b> of Zet, items and all, to overwhelm your foes.","npe_desc_loc":"Creates a copy of himself to split push","str_base":23,"str_gain":2.7999999523163,"agi_base":16,"agi_gain":2.5,"int_base":24,"int_gain":2.5999999046326,"primary_attr":1,"complexity":3,"attack_capability":2,"role_levels":[3,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0],"damage_min":47,"damage_max":57,"attack_rate":1.7000000476837,"attack_range":625,"projectile_speed":900,"armor":1.6666667461395,"magic_resistance":25,"movement_speed":285,"turn_rate":0.69999998807907,"sight_range_day":1800,"sight_range_night":800,"max_health":660,"health_regen":2.5499999523163,"max_mana":363,"mana_regen":1.2000000476837,"abilities":[{"id":5677,"name":"arc_warden_flux","name_loc":"Flux","desc_loc":"Infuses a lone enemy unit with swirling, volatile energy, slowing its movement speed and dealing damage over time.
